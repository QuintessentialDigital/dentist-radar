<h1>About Dentist Radar</h1>
<p><strong>Dentist Radar</strong> is a simple, automated alert service that helps people find NHS dental practices accepting new patients.</p>

<p>We monitor publicly available NHS practice information and notify subscribers by email as soon as a nearby dentist starts taking new patients. Our goal is to save you the time and frustration of manually checking every local practice.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>To make access to NHS dental care transparent, fast, and fair for everyone across the UK â€” using AI and automation to reduce waiting times and missed opportunities for care.</p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Dentist Radar is an independent micro-SaaS product built in the UK to solve a real problem faced by millions of patients each year. Our team combines experience in data automation, health-tech, and digital design.</p>
